*Be sure that you have installed the [CLR Host Plugin][clrhostplugin]{:target="_blank"} first.*

Once you have downloaded the plugin, go to your Open Broadcaster Software installation directory (this is typically `C:\Program Files\OBS` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\OBS`). Navigate into `plugins\CLRHostPlugin` and unzip the contents of the zip file you downloaded.

**Important:** It's possible that you will be asked to overwrite `CLRHost.Interop.dll`. Do this only when the existing file is older than 7 September 2014.
