TODOS TO CONSIDER (NOT A ROADMAP):
 - Add support for multiple lines of text
   - Instead of having one big line of text, split it into multiple lines
   - This will replace the current system with only one line
   - Each line is visible until the end of the line or for a set amount of time (maybe both, and/or relationship?)
   - Transition will probably be slide up/down, need to check if this is viable
   - When a line has no text available, skip it
   - Add an option for skipping lines when the Mumble Link is not available
   - Add an option to select when a line is visible based upon various variables
 - Add support for the GW2 API (API library already included, but not yet used at the moment)
 - Provide moooaaaar examples
